    "Julia has a lot of different data types, and we'll often ask you to return specific types from your functions. Understanding what types you're using is very important in Julia, since different methods of the same function may be called depending on the types you pass in. This exercise will help you get a little more familiar with the different data types in Julia and how to create them and check the types you're using (hint: use the `typeof` method to check the type of something).\n",

    "For your homework, we will sometimes ask you to store your answers in a specific data type, usually a dictionary. Create a dictionary named `q1a` with the following key-value pairs:\n",
    "* `:double` = a double-precision floating point number\n",
    "* `:single` = a single-precision floating point number\n",
    "* `:vecint` = a vector of integers\n",

    "* `:tuple` = a tuple of 3 integers\n",
    "* `:set` = a set of 4 integers\n",
    "* `:string` = a string\n",

Note that Julia passes all mutable types by reference. Since immutable types (such as numbers or tuples) cannot be modified, these are effectively passed by value. Functions that modify their inputs should end with a `!`, by convention (e.g. `sort` vs `sort!`). Create the following functions:\n",
    "* A function `doubler` that doubles any numeric input: `doubler(::Number)::Number`\n",
    "* A function `shift` that accepts a vector and a scalar, and returns the vector with the scalar added: `shift(::Vector, ::Real)::Vector`\n",
    "* A function `shift!` that accepts a vector and a scalar, and modifies the vector by adding the scalar to each element: `shift(::Vector, ::Real)`\n",
    "We use the Julia syntax `myfun(::Arg1Type, ::Arg2Type)::ReturnType` to specify the function signatures we expect. You don't need to specify these on your functions, since we won't pass any inputs that don't match these signatures. If we don't specify a return type, it's usually because we expect the function to modify one of it's inputs. We've started the first and third functions for you:"

This all handled by the package manager and (usually) works transparently to the user.\n",
